	<i>This was a very small try from my side to make your birthday memorable as you did for me.I really was unaware of the fact that you were there (virtually) near me on my birthday. You really made my day, you made me feel special and i can't thank you enough for that. And ha.. Cheery on the cake was all those beautiful gifts you sent with lots of love.. OMG!!! That made me go crazy. Thank you Saurabh.💖 You really secure a vital place in my life. <br>
	In the coming years I hope our bond to grow more stronger. Let's be with each other every single day encouraging, spreading happiness, boosting, caring, loving, supporting, understanding, listening, helping, learning, succeeding and being nice to everyone out there. I know this handsome guy is too precious and am not letting him go at any cost. You MUST bear me, my trantrums, my emotions (lol), my acting 😂 even now and then coz i am a maze with no escape😂</i><br>
	Finally_ _ _<br>
	Wishing you tones of happiness, infinite positive vibes, huge success and a very healthy life!!!</b><br><br>
